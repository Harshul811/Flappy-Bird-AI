# AI-Driven Flappy Bird 

## Overview

Welcome to the AI-driven Flappy Bird Mastery project! In this project, I engineered a dynamic simulation environment to train and evolve AI agents, ultimately achieving advanced decision-making skills in the popular game Flappy Bird. Using cutting-edge technologies and algorithms, I created a platform where AI agents could learn and improve their gameplay in a simulated environment.

## Project Highlights

- **Dynamic Simulation Environment**: I developed a dynamic simulation environment where AI agents could interact with the Flappy Bird game. This environment allowed for the training and evaluation of AI agents in a controlled setting.

- **Neural Network Architecture**: To power the decision-making process of AI agents, I orchestrated a neural network architecture using TensorFlow.js. This neural network enabled agents to make complex decisions in real-time during gameplay.

- **Immersive Game Rendering**: Leveraging P5.js, I created an immersive game rendering system. The combination of TensorFlow.js for decision-making and P5.js for rendering provided a seamless and visually engaging experience.

- **Genetic Algorithms**: I employed genetic algorithms to optimize AI proficiency. Through a process of evolution and selection, AI agents gradually improved their performance, resulting in impressive Flappy Bird navigation capabilities.

## Key Technologies

- **NEAT Algorithm**: The NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm served as the foundation for evolving neural networks and improving AI agents.

- **Genetic Algorithms**: Genetic algorithms were used to evolve and select the fittest AI agents, allowing them to learn and adapt over time.

- **Neural Networks**: TensorFlow.js was utilized for implementing neural networks, enabling AI agents to make intelligent decisions.

- **P5.js**: P5.js played a crucial role in creating an immersive game rendering environment, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

- **Game Development**: The project involved aspects of game development, making it an exciting fusion of AI and gaming technologies.
